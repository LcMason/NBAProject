## 📖 OVERVIEW 
Using an open API that included an array of objects, I was able to create a page allowing you to create your own team. The API I chose happened to be BallDontLie. **This app allows you to search NBA players by either first name or last name and when a player is submited to the Player Card, you can choose to either add the player as a starter or a reserve to complete your team roster.** If you would like to clear your selected players, you can simply refresh the page! 



>This page has no refreshes and no page redirects. 

## 🌟 FEATURES
*Display All Players by First & Last name upon the load of the DOM
*Search Player by either First name or Last name (Submit)
*Choose to Start Player (click)
*Choose to Bench Player (click)
Hover over Player (mouse over)
Scroll Through List of Players (scroll bar)
